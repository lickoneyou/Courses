            At the end of May, an accident took place at a combined heat and
            power plant in the Arctic city of Norilsk, in Russia’s Krasnoyarsk
            Krai. Approximately 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled out of a
            reservoir and spread into the surrounding soil and waterways. Nearly
            all of the tributaries of the Daldykan and Ambarnaya rivers around
            the plant are now contaminated with petroleum products. Greenpeace
            Russia estimates that there is at least $86.3 million in damage to
            bodies of water in the region alone. After taking several days to
            respond to the accident, officials in the Krasnoyarsk Krai declared
            a federal level emergency situation on June 3. Two days later,
            Russia’s Emergencies Ministry declared that the spill had been
            contained. Here’s what the spread of the giant fuel spill looks like
            from space.
