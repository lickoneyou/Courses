    <h1>Lockheed Blackbird</h1>

      <i>
        The Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude, strategic
        reconnaissance aircraft developed and manufactured by the American
        aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was operated by both the
        United States Air Force (USAF) and NASA.

      The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12
      reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skunk Works
      division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was
      responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of
      the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first
      aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section. At one point,
      a bomber variant of the aircraft was under consideration, before the
      program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the
      reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking
      airborne radar, and a photo camera; the SR-71 was both longer and heavier
      than the A-12, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat cockpit.
      The SR-71 designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF
      Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay, who preferred the SR (Strategic
      Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS (Reconnaissance). The aircraft
      was introduced to operational service in January 1966.
